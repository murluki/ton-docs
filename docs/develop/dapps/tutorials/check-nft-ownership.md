# Check NFT ownership with TON

## ðŸ“– What you'll learn

In this article, you'll learn how to:

- create a Telegram Bot connected with TON (using ton.js)
- work with tonapi.io in order to check ownership of NFT
- apply TON Connect 2.0 auth standard in a bot UI

Finally, develop an easy-to-use Telegram bot application that allows users to quickly and easily verify the ownership of their NFTs.

### Bot start

To start use this command:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run app
```

If your bot doesn't work correctly, compare your code with code [from this repository](https://github.com/murluki/telegram_bot_nft_check). If it didn't help, feel free to write me in telegram. You can find my telegram account below
